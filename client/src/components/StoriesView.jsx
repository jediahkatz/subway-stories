            If New York was a country, it would have the 10th largest economy in the world.

            First, it's helpful to know the main commuter gateways that bring suburbanites into the city. We can see them by viewing where the most people enter the subway system at rush hour.

            <StationHighlightComponent stationId="164">Penn</StationHighlightComponent> <StationHighlightComponent stationId="318">Station</StationHighlightComponent> is the busiest station complex in the Western Hemisphere, serving half a million passengers daily.

            <StationHighlightComponent stationId="610">Grand Central Terminal</StationHighlightComponent> is the main hub for travelers from Westchester and Connecticut.

            The PATH train runs from nearby Jersey City, Hoboken, and Newark.

            The <StationHighlightComponent stationId="611">Port Authority Bus Terminal</StationHighlightComponent> is the busiest bus terminal in the world, with 225,000 passengers passing through on a typical weekday. Our contributor, Marc Zitelli, recounts his experience commuting to Jersey from the PABT while working on a political campaign.

          <p>
            "The foot traffic was insane, like difficult to even move at points. But it was nice that I always got a seat on the bus, since everybody was coming into the city at 8 AM on weekdays, not leaving the city."

            <StationHighlightComponent stationId="612">Midtown</StationHighlightComponent> is the most popular destination for commuters arriving at the Port Authority, followed by the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="628">Financial District</StationHighlightComponent> and <StationHighlightComponent stationId="636">Downtown Brooklyn</StationHighlightComponent>, reflecting the prominence of these business districts.

            Midtown is massive, and its busiest stations dominated by the commuter gateway hubs. We can look at <StationHighlightComponent stationId="612">Lexington Avenue/51 St</StationHighlightComponent> as a representative example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Workers are coming from all over the city, especially from high-density areas with a direct trip to the station, like Jackson Heights in Queens. The largest local spike, <StationHighlightComponent stationId="397">86 St</StationHighlightComponent>, represents commuters from Yorkville, the most densely populated neighborhood in the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            A large share of riders appear to be traveling from outside New York, with spikes at <StationHighlightComponent stationId="164">Penn Station</StationHighlightComponent> and the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="611">PABT</StationHighlightComponent>. In fact, 20% of the city's workforce commutes from out of town!

            When we look at ridership to the Financial District, anchored by the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="628">Fulton St</StationHighlightComponent> station, the pattern is strikingly different. By far the largest share of riders are coming from <StationHighlightComponent stationId="610">Grand Central</StationHighlightComponent>, dwarfing those from <StationHighlightComponent stationId="318">Penn Station</StationHighlightComponent> and the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="611">Port Authority</StationHighlightComponent>.
          </p>
          <p>
            One explanation for this inbalance is that Grand Central brings commuters from wealthy suburbs like Scarsdale in Westchester and New Canaan, Connecticut. The completion of the Grand Central–LIRR connection in January 2023 has drawn Long Islanders away from Penn Station as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those demographics could be more likely to work in high-paying finance jobs. In addition, many New Jersey commuters may find the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="624">World Trade Center</StationHighlightComponent> a more convenient stop.

            Many of Brooklyn's downtown offices are a short walk from the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="636">Jay St-MetroTech</StationHighlightComponent> stop. The MetroTech Center itself was recently renamed Brooklyn Commons, after it was purchased by the investment firm Brookfield.

            There's still plenty of out-of-town traffic to Downtown Brooklyn, from the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="611">Port Authority</StationHighlightComponent>, <StationHighlightComponent stationId="164">Penn Station</StationHighlightComponent>, and the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="628">PATH train</StationHighlightComponent>. But this business district draws a higher proportion of local commuters than Manhattan's larger corridors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It serves as a hub for workers across the borough, from <StationHighlightComponent stationId="240">Park Slope</StationHighlightComponent> to <StationHighlightComponent stationId="36">Bay Ridge</StationHighlightComponent> to <StationHighlightComponent stationId="188">East New York</StationHighlightComponent>. A number of people come all the way from Queens. Most of them must transfer through Manhattan, due to the lack of interborough connections.

            For young people in New York, life unfolds most vividly after dark. In recent years, nightlife along the L train has exploded, with enticing options from <StationHighlightComponent stationId="618">8th Avenue</StationHighlightComponent> to <StationHighlightComponent stationId="126">Bushwick</StationHighlightComponent>. One of the most popular neighborhoods along the line is the East Village.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering the arrivals to <StationHighlightComponent stationId="119">1st Avenue</StationHighlightComponent> at 11 p.m. on a Saturday night, we can see that the East Village and Alphabet City are a hotbed of nightlife, with bars like Niagara, Heaven Can Wait, and The Penny Farthing drawing crowds from Midtown to Bushwick.

            Even with this plethora of options, some residents of the East Village prefer to go out in other locales, sometimes even intentionally avoiding their neighborhood. Becca Foley, a young resident, explains:
          </p>
          <p>
            “I'm 26 and the crowd in the East Village feels a lot younger. A lot of kids are visiting and some are interns, so I think it's more fun to go out with a more local scene in <StationHighlightComponent stationId="120">Williamsburg</StationHighlightComponent> and <StationHighlightComponent stationId="126">Bushwick</StationHighlightComponent>. It's mostly about the age, but I also have better conversations with people [in Bushwick] since they're more mature and there's a lot more diversity in terms of sexuality, gender, and background.”

            A smaller but equally dedicated crowd, hundreds of young revelers embark on a weekly pilgrimage to Bushwick. Featuring megaclubs like House Of Yes and a range of bars like Carousel, Abe's Pagoda, and The Johnson's, the neighborhood is inundated with partygoers who liven the streets around the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="126">Jefferson St</StationHighlightComponent>, <StationHighlightComponent stationId="127">DeKalb Avenue</StationHighlightComponent>, and <StationHighlightComponent stationId="630">Myrtle-Wyckoff</StationHighlightComponent> stops along the L train. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering, for example, the Jefferson St station at 11 PM on a Saturday evening, we can see the influx coming from <StationHighlightComponent stationId="120">Williamsburg</StationHighlightComponent>, the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="119">East Village</StationHighlightComponent>, the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="625">Lower East Side</StationHighlightComponent>, and even as far as <StationHighlightComponent stationId="611">Times Square</StationHighlightComponent> in Manhattan.

            As expected, the shifting seasons play a role in how many people are willing to make the trek to Bushwick.
          </p>
          <p>
             In the wintry months of January, February, and March, fewer people are going out than during the rest of the year. But even on the coldest nights, there is still a core group of partygoers undeterred by the wind and cold. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest month of 2023 was October. It's the perfect storm: college students are back in town and the month caps off with Halloween. Thanks to the changing climate, the weather is often still mild.

            Known for its high concentration of “open until the sun comes up" bars, Bushwick features a crowd eager to stay out later than most. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at late-night departures from stations along the L, we can see that the party rages later in Bushwick than in its tamer counterpart of Williamsburg.

            Rush hour traffic peaks on Wednesday. But by Friday, some workers have more flexibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such is the case at <StationHighlightComponent stationId="629">Metropolitan Av</StationHighlightComponent>, a trendy area in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Once an up-and-coming neighborhood, a wave of gentrification has cemented its status as a home for wealthy young creatives and tech workers.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Wednesday to Friday, the number of people catching the train at 8 a.m. drops to about 55% of its peak. This may reflect the effects of work-from-home arrangements in a post-pandemic world. By Saturday, that number is down to 15% as residents enjoy their weekend.

            The <StationHighlightComponent stationId="397">Upper East Side</StationHighlightComponent> is one of the more affluent districts in NYC, known for upscale shopping and impressive residences. With the Met and the Guggenheim nearby, it attracts many tourists seeking a dose of the city's art scene. Its east side, Yorkville, has seen a wave of new development since the arrival of the Second Avenue Subway in 2017.

            Curiously, the rush hour traffic going into the weekend follows exactly the same pattern we saw in Williamsburg. On Friday morning, only 55% of peak traffic remains. By Saturday, that ridership is again down to just 15%.

            In late summer, things get even more packed as the US Open kicks off. Eitan Darwish, a former ball boy, used to take the 7 to the Billie Jean King Tennis Center every morning.

          <p>
            “The players don't take the train, they get private cars from their hotel,” he notes. “Ball boys can take an hourly shuttle, but I think the subway is faster with the traffic.” 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Open has a morning session that starts at 11, and then an evening session at 7. We can see distinct spikes on the map before each session, with many fans again coming from out of town.

            The MTA's data is averaged over the course of the month, but major events drive enough traffic that we can pinpoint them anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eitan cautions, “The Mets play away games half the time, but some nights that overlap [with the US Open] happens. When it happens on a Semifinals night, the traffic is insane.”
          </p>
          <p>
            One such night was Wednesday, August 30, 2023. The Mets eked out a 6-5 victory over the Rangers while Zhang Zhizhen (China) upset Casper Ruud (Norway) in the 2nd round.

          <p>
            Since 2015, there's one more reason for New Yorkers to head to Flushing Meadows: the Queens Night Market.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, over one hundred vendors serve foods from cuisines all over the world. The market runs Saturdays from April to October on the west side of Flushing Meadows, off the <StationHighlightComponent stationId="449">111 St</StationHighlightComponent> stop across the highway from Citi Field.
          </p>
          <p>
            The event is the perfect essence of Queens, the most ethnically diverse place in the world. Where else can you eat Trinidadian doubles, Mongolian yak cheese, and a Sudanese sambuxa in one meal? <span className="story-end-marker"/>
